# Project Information

This is the dockerfile for generating a container that establishes the development environment for CENG519. The required packages (Microsoft SEAL and EVA) are already installed. Networkx is also installed for graph generation. You will implement a graph algorithm preserving the privacy of the graph. Note that, CKKS used by EVA is not powerful enough to do all kinds of computations. There is no comparison for instance. 

# Running the example
```
python3 519ProjectTemplate/fhe_template_project.py
```

GOOD LUCK.
